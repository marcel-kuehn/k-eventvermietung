# K-Eventverleih

This project is a website, that is connected to a cms, build for a company that offers services and equipment for events. It was created with a focus on minimal JavaScript, small bundle size, and maximum page speed, while still providing a great experience for both developers and marketers.

## Concept

### Framework

This project uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) as the main framework.  
Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites that makes it possible to ship minimal JavaScript and lean templates, while still offering a modern developer experience with components, templating, TypeScript, and more.

### Design and CSS

This project follows a simplified version of [this design system](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-colour-system-d9d39f245e01) for consistent colors and UI, .  
Styling is implemented with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Tailwind provides a good developer experience and it helps to keep the CSS bundle small and maintainable (in my opinion, not every dev would agree on that).

For further optimization [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) was added, which merges and deduplicates utility classes, resulting in a even smaller HTML file.

### CMS & Deployments

To provide a smooth workflow for marketers, we use [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) as our CMS. One key benefit is the live preview while editing content.
Because of this, we run two separate instances:

**Staging Instance**

- Purpose: Enables marketers and non-technical users to preview changes.
- Runs as a Node process using Astroâ€™s Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- Fetches the latest draft content from Storyblok on every request and renders the site with this data.
- Any changes made are instantly visible in Storyblokâ€™s preview.
- Redeployed automatically on push to the `main` branch, ensuring everyone works with the latest stable code.

**Production Instance**

- Purpose: Optimized for minimal JavaScript, small bundle size, and maximum speed.
- Runs as a static site using Astroâ€™s Static Site Generation (SSG).
- Data is fetched only during build time, not on every request.
- Deployed as a static site, making global distribution via CDN possible for fast loading worldwide.
- Redeployed automatically on push to the `production` branch or when content is published in Storyblok (this is configured by adding a deploy hook in Vercel and then adding the hook url to the webhook settings in Storyblok, where you can choose on which events the Vercel hook gets called).
- Tradeoffs to keep in mind here:
  - This project has to be rebuild, when new content in Storyblok get published, so it takes a few minutes for everything to reload. I think it is worth it because we can heavily reduce our traffic usage to Storyblok using this approach and also distribute this site on a CDN, instead of having to run a Node process.
  - If content on sites is frequently **published** (not drafted!), this approach can lead to a lot of deployments. If you have multiple people publishing new content multiple times a day this approach is not for you. In my case I publish new content like once a month, so it's not a problem.

We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as our hosting provider because it makes deployments seamless. Vercel automatically redeploys when changes are detected in the `main` or `production` branches.
